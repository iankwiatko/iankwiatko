<h1>Hi, I'm Ian! <br/></h1>
I am a current fourth-year student studying Software Engineering at The Ohio State University, with hands-on experience in full-stack agile web development using Java, Ruby on Rails, and other industry-standard tools. Iâ€™ve worked on diverse projects, including modernizing internal systems, optimizing APIs that handle thousands of daily requests, and creating databases that hold crucial information. In my free time, I also enjoy working on coding projects of all sorts, from creating small indie games using Python, to making web-apps that help solve problems!
This page contains some of my projects, both personal and some that have been implemented in a buisness enviornment.

<h1>Hi, I'm Ian! <br/></h1>
Im a BS in Computer Science and Engineering Graduate from Ohio State University, with hands-on experience in full-stack agile web development using Java, Ruby on Rails, and other industry-standard tools. Iâ€™ve worked on diverse projects, including optimizing APIs that handle thousands of daily requests, modernizing internal systems to perform at their best, and creating databases that hold crucial information. In my free time, I also enjoy working on coding projects of all sorts, and heres where they come to life.
